    "bio":"Growing up, I was always fond of anything related to technology, from phones and video games to cars. My interest in computer science was piqued in 10th grade after being introduced to the video game ''WatchDogs''. The game required players to hack into cars, surveillance cameras, and people's phones to complete missions. Soon after realizing my passion for computer science, I joined my school's computer science club, where we worked on projects and hosted weekly gaming tournaments. I took my first computer science class in my senior year of high school. I decided I wanted to pursue a bachelor's degree in computer science and hope to get a master's degree in software engineering.",
